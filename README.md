A little helper if the patients, prisoners or missions are too many ... for you! :smiley:

> Is it possible to send vehicles, even to existing missions?<br>
> <ins>Sure - why not?</ins>! „_You can only send the vehicles within a defined radius, for alliance missions or leave it alone!_“

> Can prisoners be transported and patients deliver to hospitals?<br>
> „_<ins>Of course!</ins> - set a radius and the prisoners or patients will be released if there is no cell or bed available!_“
