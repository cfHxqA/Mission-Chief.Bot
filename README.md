# Mission-Chief.Bot ![status](https://badgen.net/badge/Status/Proof/green) ![version](https://badgen.net/badge/Version/3.0.0.0/) ![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/365129052832530433.svg?label=BotNix&logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff&color=7389D8&labelColor=6A7EC2)

A little helper if the patients, prisoners or missions are too many ... for you! :smiley:

> Is it possible to send vehicles, even to existing missions?<br>
> <ins>Sure - why not?</ins>! „_You can only send the vehicles within a defined radius, for alliance missions or leave it alone!_“

> Can prisoners be transported and patients deliver to hospitals?<br>
> „_<ins>Of course!</ins> - set a radius and the prisoners or patients will be released if there is no cell or bed available!_“
